R Markdown Assignment for MSA8310

You will need all of the files in the same directory in order for the rmarkdown to work as intended.

Easiest way to run this .Rmd file:

Download all the files as a Zip file using the green Code button

Unzip the contents into a folder on your PC

Open the 'RMarkdown_Assignment.rmd' file

Once R Studio is open, navigate to Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location

Then Knit away!!
*R Studio has the conversion package knitr built into the application, so there is a button all ready for converting (Knit)

I recommend Knitting both a Word and HTML document
So you can see the Word Template in action and how the HTML output differs
Especially the Data section Tab feature - word doesnt do it justice.
